       This feature enables users to efficiently upload up to 2,000 records in a single batch, streamlining data management for categories such as spares, products, users, and centers. Instead of manually adding each record one by one, users can utilize an Excel-based approach to update data in bulk. To begin, a template with existing data can be downloaded using the "Download Existing Data" button. This Excel file provides a structured format, allowing users to easily add new entries or update existing ones directly within the file. After completing the data entry in Excel, users can upload the file and utilize the "Preview Data" button to review the changes before finalizing them. This preview ensures accuracy and allows users to verify the batch upload. By enabling bulk additions, this feature eliminates the time-consuming process of entering individual records, significantly reducing manual effort. It supports various data categories, including spare parts, products, users, and centers, providing comprehensive flexibility for data updates. With the ability to handle up to 2,000 records at once, this functionality is an effective solution for managing large datasets efficiently, ensuring faster and error-free updates within the system.
