        The Product Inventory section in your CRM is designed to efficiently manage product lifecycle and stock levels. It includes essential tabs such as "Product Stock" for monitoring inventory, "Product PO" (Purchase Orders) for restocking items, and "Product Updates" for making necessary adjustments or changes to the product database. The "Scrap Returns" tab helps manage defective or unsellable products, ensuring they're removed from active inventory.
